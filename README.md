This WIP package is dedicated to model fitting, essentially with
spectrometry in mind. It is a pure Julia package that mostly relies on
the [NLS_Solver.jl](https://github.com/vincent-picaud/NLS_Solver.jl)
package to solve the associated nonlinear least squares problems.

You can find further details in the
[dev-documentation](https://vincent-picaud.github.io/NLS_Fit.jl/dev).
